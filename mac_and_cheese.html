                <li>
                    <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high. Add pasta and cook according to package directions for al dente. Drain,

                <li>
                    <p>Stir in milk, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne, nutmeg, and turmeric and bring to a boil over high, stirring occasionally.
                        Reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until squash is tender, about 6 minutes. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Transfer squash mixture into a blender and add Dijon mustard. Secure lid on blender, and remove center piece to allow steam to escape.
                        Place a clean towel over opening. Process until very smooth, about 30 seconds. 
                        (Alternatively, puree soup with an immersion blender until smooth, about 3 minutes).</p>

                    <p>Combine pasta and pureed squash in a Dutch oven; heat over medium for 2 minutes. Stir in Cheddar, Gouda, and Parmesan, cooking on low until smooth, about 1 minute. Add 1/4 cup reserved pasta water,
                        stirring often, and add more as needed until the sauce is creamy, about 2 minutes. Season with salt to taste.</p>
