# odin-recipes
Created a website called Odin recipe base on the assignment given on the Odin project.

Here I was task to create 1 website that emcompasses 4 webpages, that includes the landing page, and 3 webpages didicated for recipes.
The website was built by using pure basic html elements.

In my opinion the website looks terrible, but that supposed to be expected as a new learner.
I will continue to improve my skills and knowledge.
